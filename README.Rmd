## Overview

vqtl2 is a drop-in extension of qtl2, providing the functions to accommodate variance heterogeneity arising from background factors and detect vQTL, as described in the literature:

* [QTL Mapping on a Background of Variance Heterogeneity](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3767)
* [Mean-Variance QTL Mapping Identifies Novel QTL for Circadian Activity and Exploratory Behavior in Mice](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3783)
* [vqtl: an R package for Mean-Variance QTL Mapping (version 1)](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3757)

The central functions of package `vqtl2` are:

* `scan1var()` conducts a genome scan
* `scan1var_perm()` conducts permutations to assess the statistical significance of findings
* `plot_scan1var()` plots the association statistic(s) at each genetic locus
* `plot_allele_effects()` plots the genetic and non-genetic effects at a given locus

These all inter-operate with package `qtl` and follow most of the same paradigms.

If you are new to QTL mapping, the best place to start is the
[Karl Broman's website](https://kbroman.org/).

## Installation

I plan to put `vqtl2` on CRAN, but until then, the easiest way to get `vqtl2` is from github.
The easiest way to download and install an R package from github is with the devtools package, which is available on CRAN.
Here's the `R` code to do that:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github(repo = 'rcorty/vqtl2')
```

## Usage (incomplete)

```{r, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(qtl2)
library(vqtl2)

# read in cross per qtl2
# my_DO_cross <- read_cross2(file = 'path_to_my_cross')

my_s1v <- scan1var(pheno_name = 'WBC',
                   mean_covar_names = c('NEUT', 'Sex'),
                   var_covar_names = c('Sex', 'Batch'),
                   alleleprobs = tiny_DO_ap,
                   non_genetic_data = cbind(tiny_DO_cross$pheno,
                                            tiny_DO_cross$covar))

# simplest call -- uses lots of defaults
# need to change the plot function to use generic?
plot_scan1var(s1v = my_s1v, genetic_map = tiny_DO_cross$gmap)
# what = 'association', stat = empirical_p if available, LR otherwise
# meanorvar = 'both'

# here we get allele effects on mean and variance
plot(x = my_s1v, what = 'allele_effects')

# here we get covariate effects on mean and variance
plot(x = my_s1v, what = c('covar_effects'))

# this plotting function uses ggplot2, so you can change it before you "render"
plot(x = my_s1v) + geom_hline(yintercept = 2) + theme_dark()

```
