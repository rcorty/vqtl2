## Overview

vqtl2 is a drop-in extension of qtl2, providing the functions to accommodate variance heterogeneity arising from background factors and detect vQTL, as described in the literature:

* [QTL Mapping on a Background of Variance Heterogeneity](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3767)
* [Mean-Variance QTL Mapping Identifies Novel QTL for Circadian Activity and Exploratory Behavior in Mice](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3783)
* [vqtl: an R package for Mean-Variance QTL Mapping (version 1)](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3757)

The central functions of package `vqtl2` are:

* `scan1var()` conducts a genome scan
* `scan1var_perm()` conducts permutations to assess the statistical significance of findings
* `mean_var_plot()` plots the genetic and non-genetic effects at a given locus

These all inter-operate with package `qtl` and follow most of the same paradigms.

If you are new to QTL mapping, the best place to start is the
[Karl Broman's website](https://kbroman.org/).

## Installation

I plan to put `vqtl2` on CRAN, but until then, the easiest way to get `vqtl2` is from github.
The easiest way to download and install an R package from github is with the devtools package, which is available on CRAN.
Here's the `R` code to do that:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github(repo = 'rcorty/vqtl2')
```

## Usage

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(vqtl2)
# todo
```
